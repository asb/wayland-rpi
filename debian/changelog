wayland (0.95.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Migrate to multiarch.
  * copyright: Refresh.
  * control: Update Standards-Version to 3.9.3, no changes.
  * rules: Make it non-fatal to fail the tests, which don't all succeed
    when ran in headless mode.
  * rules: Drop the creation of hard dependencies, wayland should be
    mostly API stable now.
  * rules: Drop dh_auto_install override.  dh_auto_install automatically
    installs to debian/tmp whenever there are multiple binary packages.
  * libwayland*.install: Add missing files.
  * rules: Temporarily disable installing the protocol docs, decide where
    to put them first.
  * Add README.source
  * Switch to source format 3.0 (quilt) due to the xz tarball.

wayland (0.85.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Wayland/Weston aren't quite ready to replace Xorg yet, but let's
    upload those to unstable anyway, so that people can find out by
    themselves. On the plus side, mesa can stop getting wayland support
    enabled in experimental, then disabled back when uploaded to unstable.
  * Update long description, wayland-demos got replaced by weston.

  * First upstream release:
    - http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.freedesktop.wayland.devel/1770
  * Update watch file, even if that's only useful for notifications:
    upstream releases xz tarballs, and the 1.0 source format only suports
    gz.
